# JavaScript_Training
Reviewing JavaScipt with new specificities. 

JavaScript is a scripting language primarily used in interactive web pages and as such is an essential part of web applications. Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is at the heart of the languages used by web developers. A large majority of websites use it, and the majority of web browsers have a JavaScript engine to interpret it.
This revision made it possible to update the specificities of this language from ES6 to ES11 with mini projects.
